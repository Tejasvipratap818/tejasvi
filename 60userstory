Description

=== Functionnality already exists in the UCAN parts store ===

To enhance flexibility for users who cannot find their desired Ship-To address in the pre-filled list, we will introduce a manual Ship-To address entry option. Users will be able to click a link to reveal a form where they can input their shipping details. Once entered, these details will be transferred to SAP ECC in the appropriate fields using a dedicated dummy Ship-To account specifically created for web orders.

Currently, users can only select a Ship-To address from predefined options linked to their Sold-To account. This creates issues when:

• The desired Ship-To address is not listed.

• Users need to ship to a new location that is not yet registered in our database.

To solve this, we will:

• Add a clickable link: "Click here to enter your shipping address manually." Show Expand/collapse after the sentence

• Reveal a manual input form with the following fields

Mandatory Fields:

Establishment Name

Country (auto-filled based on user location from B2BUnit Country field)

Postal Code (validated format per country, find attached the postal code format mapping)

City (dropdown suggestions based on postal code)

Street

Phone Number

Optional Fields:

Attention To

Delivery Instructions

Ensure that orders placed using manual address entry are linked to a unique dummy Ship-To account in SAP ECC: (created by Kristy)

• Allow users to collapse the form to return to the initial address selection view.

• If users go back, reset the manually entered values to prevent incorrect submissions.

• Ensure all fields are mapped correctly to SAP ECC to prevent data loss or incorrect order processing.

• Restrict this functionality to FLC Western Europe (WE) orders only at this stage.

Acceptance Criteria
