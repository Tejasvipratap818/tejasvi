TC_001 | Verify Promotion Data Transfer to SAP ECC | Ensure that promotion details from Hybris are correctly transferred to SAP ECC without manual intervention | | | |
| Step 1 | Login to Hybris and initiate order creation | User should be able to access the order creation page | | | |
| Step 2 | Apply a valid promotion during checkout | Promotion details (code, discount) should be successfully applied to the order | | | |
| Step 3 | Complete the order and transmit to SAP ECC | Promotion details should be included in the transmitted order without any validation error | | | |

| TC_002 | Validate Handling of Inactive Promotions | Ensure that orders fail if a promotion is inactive in SAP ECC, and a failed flag is sent to middleware with an email to SME | | | |
| Step 1 | Login to Hybris and initiate order creation | User should be able to access the order creation page | | | |
| Step 2 | Apply a promotion that is inactive in SAP ECC | Promotion should be applied without error on the Hybris side | | | |
| Step 3 | Complete the order and transmit to SAP ECC | Order should be flagged as a failed order in Hybris, SAP ECC should send a failed flag to middleware, and an email should be sent to SME | | | |

| TC_003 | Verify Multiple Promotions Handling | Ensure that multiple promotions on a single order are processed correctly in SAP ECC | | | |
| Step 1 | Login to Hybris and initiate order creation | User should be able to access the order creation page | | | |

| Step 2 | Apply an inactive promotion and complete the order | Order should be flagged as failed in Hybris and SAP ECC | Order will be stuck in failed order list in Hybris. Promotion code does not exist in SAP ECC, and SAP ECC generates a message to middleware and Hybris stating that the order is not processed | | |
| Step 3 | Manually resolve the promotion issue in SAP ECC or Hybris | Promotion mismatch should be corrected | | | |
| Step 4 | Re-trigger the failed order manually in Hybris | Order should be processed successfully without requiring customer re-submission | | | |
