User Story Explanation:
Ye user story keh rahi hai ki SAP ECC ke Sold-To account se freight code ko automatically checkout process me apply karna hai by mapping it to the B2BUnit in Hybris.

Key Features & Functionality:
Freight Code Mapping:

SAP ECC me jo Freight Code field hai, usko Hybris ke B2BUnit ke saath link karna hai.
Freight Code = FRTEU define kiya gaya hai, jo checkout ke waqt automatically select hoga.
Checkout Process Improvement:

Jab user checkout karega, toh freight code pre-selected hoga based on uske B2BUnit.
Isse manual selection ki zaroorat nahi padegi, aur accuracy & efficiency improve hogi.
Freight Code Configuration in Hybris:

Freight codes ko Hybris me configure karna hoga, jisme names, thresholds (minimum order values), aur prices included hon.
Quotation Process Enhancement:

Quotation process me bhi freight charges apply hone chahiye.
Jab quotation generate ho, tab freight cost properly calculate aur display honi chahiye.
Order Confirmation:

Checkout ke baad freight charges accurately apply hon aur order confirmation me bhi visible ho.
Acceptance Criteria:
âœ… SAP ECC se correct freight code Hybris ke B2BUnit me map ho.
âœ… Checkout ke dauraan freight code automatically select ho.
âœ… Freight codes aur unke associated details (names, thresholds, prices) Hybris me configure ho.
âœ… Freight charges quotation process me calculate aur display ho.
âœ… Freight charges checkout ke dauraan sahi apply ho aur order confirmation me visible ho.

Summary:
Basically, SAP ECC ka freight code Hybris ke B2BUnit ke saath map karna hai, taki checkout ke dauraan freight code automatically select ho, freight cost quotation aur order confirmation me sahi show ho, aur efficiency improve ho.

You said:
client se is user story se puchh sakte h open query
ChatGPT said:
Haan, kuch important open queries hain jo aap client se clarify kar sakte ho taki implementation smooth ho:

1. Freight Code Mapping & Logic:
ðŸ”¹ Freight Code Mapping:

Kya har B2BUnit ke liye ek unique Freight Code hoga, ya multiple freight codes assign ho sakte hain?
Agar kisi B2BUnit ke liye freight code available na ho, toh default code assign karna hai ya error dikhana hai?
ðŸ”¹ Region-Specific Rules:

Kya freight codes country ya region-specific honge, ya sabhi European B2BUnits ke liye same code (FRTEU) valid hoga?
Kya Warehouse ya Shipping Method ke basis par freight code change ho sakta hai?
2. Checkout & Quotation Process:
ðŸ”¹ Quotation Process Handling:

Kya freight cost real-time calculate karna hai SAP se, ya pre-configured rules ke basis par apply hoga?
Kya quotation ke dauraan freight code manually change kar sakte hain users, ya fixed rahega?
ðŸ”¹ Checkout Freight Selection:

Agar user manually freight code change karna chahe, toh kya ye allow hoga ya system-enforced logic hoga?
Kya express shipping ya bulk orders ke liye different freight codes assign karne ka scope hai?
3. Technical Integration & Data Flow:
ðŸ”¹ SAP to Hybris Data Flow:

Freight codes SAP se real-time fetch honge ya scheduled batch update hoga?
Kya freight cost calculation ke liye koi additional SAP module integrate karna hoga?
ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Logs:

Agar SAP me koi freight code missing ho, toh default code apply hoga ya order process block hoga?
Kya freight code mapping me koi audit trail ya logging chahiye for tracking errors/debugging?
4. Pricing & Thresholds:
ðŸ”¹ Threshold & Pricing Rules:

Minimum order value (thresholds) freight codes ke basis par fixed honi chahiye ya configurable?
Kya freight discounts ya promotions ka koi logic implement karna hai?
ðŸ”¹ Currency & Multi-Language Support:

Kya freight charges multi-currency format me show hone chahiye, ya sirf EUR/GBP/SEK me calculate honge?
Freight code details (names, descriptions) multi-language support ke saath dikhani hain ya sirf English me?
5. Order Confirmation & Display:
ðŸ”¹ Freight Code Visibility:

Kya order confirmation email me freight code explicitly dikhana hai, ya sirf charges show karne hain?
Kya backend users (Customer Service) ko freight code modify karne ka option chahiye order processing ke dauraan?
Summary:
Ye queries business logic, checkout behavior, SAP integration, pricing, aur error handling ko clarify karne me help karegi. Isse aapko clear implementation roadmap milega, aur future issues avoid honge.

Hereâ€™s the meaning of each test case step:

TC_003 | Verify Freight Code Configuration in Hybris
Purpose: Ensure that freight codes and their attributes (names, thresholds, prices) are correctly configured in Hybris.

Navigate to the Hybris Backoffice and open the Freight Code configuration section.
Go to the administrative panel (Backoffice) in Hybris where freight codes are managed.
Validate that all necessary freight data (names, thresholds, prices) are available.
Check if all required details are correctly stored for each freight code.
Expected Result: The freight codes should have all required attributes properly set up.
TC_004 | Verify Freight Charges Calculation in Quotation Process
Purpose: Ensure that freight charges are correctly calculated when generating a quotation.

Create a quotation for a B2B customer in Hybris.
Generate a price quotation for a business customer.
Verify that the correct freight charge is applied based on the configured freight code.
Check if the system applies the expected freight charge automatically.
Expected Result: Freight charges should be correctly calculated and displayed in the quotation.
TC_005 | Verify Freight Charges Application During Checkout
Purpose: Ensure the correct freight charge is applied in the final order summary.

Proceed to checkout with an order that meets the freight threshold.
Place an order that qualifies for a freight charge based on the threshold.
Verify that the correct freight charge is applied in the final order summary.
Check if the order summary includes the correct freight charge before confirming the purchase.
Expected Result: The correct freight charge should be applied and appear in the order confirmation.
Negative Test Cases
TC_006 | Verify Error Handling for Missing Freight Code Mapping
Purpose: Ensure the system handles cases where a userâ€™s B2BUnit does not have a freight code assigned.

Attempt checkout with a user whose B2BUnit has no freight code mapping.
Try placing an order with a B2B account that lacks a mapped freight code.
Check if the system allows checkout or throws an error.
Verify whether the system prevents checkout or prompts the user to select a freight code.
Expected Result: The system should either require a valid freight code or block the checkout process.
TC_007 | Verify Error Handling for Incorrect Freight Code in SAP ECC
Purpose: Check how the system reacts when an invalid or non-configured freight code is entered in SAP ECC.

Enter an invalid or non-configured freight code in SAP ECC.
Modify or input a freight code that does not exist in the system.
Verify if the freight code syncs to Hybris or triggers an error.
Check whether the incorrect code is transferred to Hybris or flagged as an error.
Expected Result: Hybris should reject incorrect freight codes and log an appropriate error message.
TC_008 | Verify Incorrect Freight Charges Calculation
Purpose: Ensure the system prevents incorrect manual overrides of freight charges.

Create a quotation and manually override the freight charge.
Try changing the automatically applied freight charge to a different amount.
Compare the applied charge with the expected configured charge.
Verify if the system allows unauthorized modifications.
Expected Result: The system should not allow incorrect freight charge overrides.
Summary
TC_003 to TC_005 focus on verifying correct freight code setup, calculation, and application.
TC_006 to TC_008 check how the system handles missing, incorrect, or manipulated freight
