Description

As a customer, I want the ability to reorder products directly from my Order History page, so I can quickly repurchase items without manually adding them to my cart.

Acceptance Criteria

UI/UX Requirements:

• A "Reorder" button is visible in the Order History page.

• Clicking the button will:

1) Add all products from the selected order to the cart.

2) Display a confirmation message: "Your items have been added to the cart."

3) If any product is out of stock or discontinued:

Display a notification: "Some items are unavailable and were not added to the cart."

List the unavailable products

Behavior:

• Products from the selected order are added to the cart with the same quantities as the original order.

• Any discounts, pricing, or promotions applied will reflect the current system rules, not the original order's conditions.

Backend Integration:

• Pull order data from the database to populate the reorder functionality.

• Validate product availability and stock levels in real-time before adding items to the cart.

Error Handling:

• If the order contains invalid or inactive products:

• Notify the user: "Some products in this order cannot be reordered. Please contact support if required."

• Ensure the system does not add duplicate products to the cart.
